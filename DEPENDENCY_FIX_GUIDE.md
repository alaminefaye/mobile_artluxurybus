# 🔧 Fix for main.dart Import Errors & CocoaPods Conflict

## ❌ Current Problem:
- `flutter_riverpod` and other packages not found
- This happened because `mobile_scanner ^5.3.0` doesn't exist
- `flutter pub get` failed, so no packages were installed

## ✅ Solution Steps:

### 1. **First, run Flutter pub get** (to fix main.dart errors):

```bash
# Add Flutter to PATH or use full path
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin  # Update with your Flutter path
cd /Users/mouhamadoulaminefaye/Desktop/PROJETS\ DEV/mobile_dev/artluxurybus
flutter pub get
```

**Alternative if Flutter not in PATH:**
- Open your IDE's terminal
- Navigate to project root
- Run `flutter pub get` from IDE terminal

### 2. **Fix CocoaPods GoogleUtilities conflict:**

```bash
cd ios
rm -f Podfile.lock
rm -rf Pods/
pod install --repo-update
```

### 3. **If CocoaPods not installed:**

```bash
# Install CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## 🛠️ Changes Made:

✅ **Reverted pubspec.yaml**: `mobile_scanner: ^5.2.3` (working version)  
✅ **Updated Podfile**: Added conflict resolution for GoogleUtilities  
✅ **Set iOS deployment target**: 14.0+ for all pods  

## 🚀 Expected Results:

After running `flutter pub get`:
- ✅ All import errors in `main.dart` should disappear
- ✅ `flutter_riverpod` will be available  
- ✅ All other dependencies resolved

After `pod install`:
- ✅ GoogleUtilities version conflict resolved
- ✅ Firebase and mobile_scanner working together

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check Flutter installation:**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Force clean everything:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install
   ```

3. **Manual dependency resolution:** 
   Add this to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$(whoami)/flutter/bin
   ```

## 📱 Test the Fix:

1. Run `flutter pub get` 
2. Check that `main.dart` has no red underlines
3. Build iOS: `flutter build ios --no-codesign`
